# Oracle High Performance Computing Contest - Fall 2020

_Author: **Nicolas Racchi**, BSc Automation Engineering student at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it)_

> This repository contains all the content for my submission to the **Graph ML** contest.

## Installation and running the model

The easiest and best way to run my submission is by using the `script` I prepared, which will cycle
through all the steps automatically.

NOTE: The dataset is automatically pulled from the original [repository](https://github.com/AlbertoParravicini/high-performance-graph-analytics-2020/tree/main/track-ml/data) of the contest, so you don't have to install it manually.

```bash
# 1 Clone the repo
# 2 cd in the project folder
# 3 Optional: activate your virtualenv (or equivalent)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python script.py
```

## Written report

Please refer to my written report for the specific implementation details.
