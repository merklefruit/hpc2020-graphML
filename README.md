# Oracle Labs High Performance Computing Contest - Fall 2020

Nicolas Racchi, BSc Automation Engineering student at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it)

> This repository contains all the material for my submission to the **Graph ML** contest.

## How to run the model

The easiest way to run my submission is by using the `script`, which will cycle
through all the steps automatically.

Note: you don't have to download any additional data since the dataset is included in this repo
(about 50MB)

```bash
# 1 Clone the repo
# 2 cd in the project folder
# 3 Optional: activate your virtualenv (or equivalent)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python script.py
```

## Written report

Please refer to my written report for the implementation details.
